I am Felix Agyemang (PhD), a Research Associate at the School of Geographical Sciences, University of Bristol.
My research is focused on a) understanding and modelling urbanization processes in developing cities, b)
building tools for simulating and predicting socio-spatial patterns of growth for cities and urban systems; and
c) informing urban planning and governance practices.
