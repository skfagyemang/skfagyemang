I am a Lecturer in Spatial Data Science at the Department of Planning and Environmental Management (PEM), University of Manchester.
My research centers around (1) understanding and modelling urbanisation processes in developing cities, (2) building tools for simulating and predicting socio-spatial patterns of growth for cities and urban systems, and (3) developing advanced machine learning models for generating socio-economic data and predicting living conditions.
